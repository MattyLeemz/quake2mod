In order to install this mod, you need to be in the repository in quake2mod. 
After that you can find the final project to play this mod within the branch FinalProject.
After cloning the project to git and switching branches to FinalProject.  You are ready to start playing!

Once in Quake 2 the mod should automatically open up to the mod.  Due to time constraints and the sheer amount of problems and stress caused by COVID-19
Only 2 of the 5 deliverables have been completed.  Nevertheless, here is how to view them.

Crazy Weapons Behavior Deliverables:
In order to see this deliverable you must open up the console when in the game level of single player.  In order to open the console
press the "~" key.  Then type in the following "give all".  This will give the player all weapons.  The four weapons I have made behavioral changes to
are the blaster, the grenade launcher, and the BFG.  The blaster by default just shoots a blaster bolt.  Also in case if you switch to a weapon later and want to access the default blaster again, press 1 on the keyboard.  In this mod I made it so that after a certain distance,
when the blaster bolt hits a surface, rockets are released from the impact point in random directions.  The next weapon i modified to have a behavior change was the 
Grenade Launcher.  By pressing 6 on your keyboard you will have access to the grenade launcher.  the change is that the grenade launcher still shoots 1 grenade, but the grenade doesn't despawn and is infinetly exploding and hopping around.  So for example, if you shoot three grenades, three greandes will be hopping around exploding forever.  When you press 8 on the keyboard you will have access to the hyper blaster.  Essentially the hyper blaster acts the same as the blaster except fully automatic and more sporatically.  The final weapon I modified was the BFG, you can switch to it by pressing 0.  Which was once a one shot at a time weapons of destruction, it is now burst fire.  it shoots 3 giant balls of death at enemies.


Super Power Deliverable
One of my deliverables was to have a super power for the player.  I took inspiration from the game shadow the hedgehog, specifically the chaod blast attack which is an AOE
attack of an explosion that surround the player and hurts enemies around you.  In order to see this deliverable, once you are in the game, open up the console with "~" and type in "superpower" once the console closes, an explosion will be seen happening around the player.  In order to activate it again, you need to activate the console and retype it again.  enemies around you will take damage and you will take a bit of damage yourself.  **NOTE** I tried to map it to a button but it didn't work when i tried changing in the config file.
Which is why we have to resort to console commands to access the super power.
